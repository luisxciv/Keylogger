# WKeylogger
This is a simple Keylogger built on C++

The purpose of this keylogger is to put it on a USB and run the setup file. The keys will be logged in the config/windows/sys32/log.txt file. The .exe file is located in the same directory. 

The USB files along with the autorun.inf are made to resemble a Microsoft Office Word Installation Drive. 

I have also included the cpp file in here if you want to make any changes or contribute.
